			<p> Responsive design is a fundamental concept in web design.  It is a web design strategy that uses dynamic changes on how the website appears, depending on the device's orientation under view and the screen size. It enables html to be served on all web pages using css, which determines the web pages and page designs. In a responsive design, there is the ability of web pages to reshuffle with the growth of the view. A three-column desktop design can reshuffle into two templates for smartphones and tablets (Hung & Wang, 2021). It also provides a similar way to access the website without considering the type of device being used.  The ability to hide information or knowledge from users is based on the type of users one has.  </p>

			<p>  Responsive design relates to web technologies in a way that it consists of flexible layouts and grids, images, and the creative use of CSS.  The technology can accommodate all the users of different gadgets like laptops, desktops, and tablets through the automatic switch, scripting abilities, and image size (Laine, et al, 2021). Responsive design is about screen resolutions that can be adjusted and automatically resizable images and the new approach of web design.</p>

			<p>  Through my research have learned that for a website to be built on different devices, is to understand how customers interact with your website to enable you to analyze the traffic on the website to determine precisely the source of visitors on your site, the type of content being used and type of the devices being used primarily.  Understanding the context in which the apps will be used is essential. I have learned that it is also essential to utilizing responsive design, ensuring the content display is correct. It is uniformly distributed on different devices, screen sizes, and platforms.  I realized through the research that it is critical to creating a dedicated mobile website with a solution to navigation problems and the capability to complete the forms quickly.   I learned that it is vital to understand consistency and differences in operating systems. Navigation in a different operating system is vital to go back to the app. The visual styles between the two operating systems are worthy of looking at; they will enable you to customize the UI and realize actual guidelines</p>

			<p>   I have learned primary programming languages in the course, which are fundamentals of programming and web designing, consisting of Javascript, PHP, html, Query languages, and database.   I  have learned different web design software and tools a designer needs to know to kick start his career. It was vital for me to familiarize myself with different web browser tools like adobe photoshop.  In addition, I also learned time management skills because a good and successful designer should stay on time and schedule to ensure successful completion of the projects. I have also discovered essential communication skills, which are essential during web design (Kearney-Volpe, 2021). There is a need to be effective in communication to engage users and know which type of requirements they need on the applications; it also helps in getting customer response.  </p>
